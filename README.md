## Description 

This website is a mock portfolio developed by Justin Dong that only utilizes HTML and CSS. No javascript was used during this proces. The mock portfolio is displayed to represent the knowledge of css and html that I have learned thus far. This project is currently in development and will not be used in real life career hunting situations.
